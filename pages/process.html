        I am an energetic Interactive Arts + Technology and Communications student with 4 years of experience in the
        field of design thinking, graphic design, and copywriting.
        I believe design is necessary to make life more comfortable, convenient, efficient, and affordable to not only
        human beings but also to the environment.
        Possessed with both abundant design thinking and knowledge of HTML and CSS, I am capable of incorporating and
        blending both aspects to refine a better product for users.
