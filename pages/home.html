        I am a fourth-year student at SFUâ€™s School of Interactive Arts + Technology (SIAT)
        focusing on user interface (UI) design. With an education in UI design, I seek to create meaningful design
        solutions and experiences for brands and audiences. I aim to put the fun in functional designs by successfully
        differentiating narratives through the visualization of my design work. I enjoy the creative process but
        understand
        that creativity without empathy lacks purpose. My background in user interface design is accented by a
        multidisciplinary
        skill set that includes HTML, CSS, Adobe Illustrator, Figma, Protopie, in conjunction with my skills in visual
        design, UX methods,
        content strategy and project management, to formulate intuitive, engaging, and persuasive designs.
