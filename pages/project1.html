                    During the fall semester of 2021, I enrolled in IAT 235. This course
                    introduces theory and practice of designing visual representations of information.
                    I learned to visually translate textual, numerical and evidentiary information so
                    that it can be communicated to diverse user communities and contexts. The final project
                    allowed students to incorporate their design thinking and coding skills to create a user
                    friendly website for the Vancouver School Board. The entirety of the process from researching
                    to designing to coding a functional website took roughly about one month.
                    <br>
                    Before starting any of the design processes, our team needed to comprehend the website’s
                    purpose. We also needed to do our own investigation, certainly in close collaboration with the
                    client, which in this case is the Vancouver School Board and the users. We sat down and considered
                    these questions:
                    <br>
                <h4>
                    UX RESEARCH
                </h4>
                <p>
                    - Who is the site for?<br>
                    - What exactly does the audience expect or look for?<br>
                    - Is this website’s primary aim to inform, sell, or amuse?<br>
                    - How do you want to stand out from the competitor sites?<br>
                    - Are there any websites with designs that you like? Why?<br>
                </p>
                </p>

                The second part of the process includes “define and ideation”. In this step, our team now knows exactly
                what the users needs and goals when viewing the website. In order to start thinking about the design of
                the overall site, we started brainstorming what information needs to be included in the final site and
                what pages are needed for this. Thus, we created a user flow to better visualize the entirety of the
                site. In a user flow, the user follows a path through a product that includes their decision points.
                User flows differ from flowcharts in that they can start off pretty simply to determine key user
                journeys, but they can easily lead to more complicated flows by adding all the different decisions a
                user can make.
                <br>
                <br>
                After finalizing the user flow, we went ahead and created wireframes for the mobile and desktop versions
                of the site. In this stage we have to turn our thoughts to the initial website framework through three
                steps of wireframing: low, medium, and lastly, high fidelity wireframes.

                From the previous step of wireframing, we then prototyped the high fidelity wireframe. While not the
                final coded website, a prototype simulates a website’s look and behavior as closely as possible.
                Designers use prototypes for user testing to receive valuable feedback about the site’s usability.

                Lastly, after receiving valuable feedback and taking this into consideration when redesigning a few
                elements, we coded the actual wireframe into a fully working website.

                Problems our team encountered during the process were designing the overall layout of the website and
                coding it. Our team went through multiple designs and figured out which one worked well and aligned with
                the Vancouver School Board’s user’s needs and goals. After going through many iterations, we ultimately
                went forward with the design above. It showcases the information in a clean and simple layout with easy
                to see buttons and makes it easy for parents or other adults to look at.
