        <p>
            During the spring semester of 2023, I enrolled in IAT 334. This course provides an introduction to
            the art and design of human-computer interfaces, design methods, prototyping and evaluation of user
            interfaces. Examines issues of interactivity and its relation to human contexts and technological
            systems.The second group project allowed students to incorporate their design thinking to create a
            user friendly application for seniors. Our team decided to create a medication reminder application
            that lets seniors keep track of their medication. The entirety of the process from researching to
            designing the application took roughly about one month.
            <br>
            Before starting any of the design processes, our team needed to do user research. We had to consider
            these questions:
            <br>
        </p>

        <h4>
            QUESTIONS:
        </h4>
        <p>
            - What is the design domain your team has chosen to design for? <br>
            - Based on initial research (cite your sources and show evidence of research)<br>
            - Who are the people in this domain?<br>
            - What are common goals of people in this domain?<br>
            - What are some common activities?<br>
            - What challenges or opportunities (for users) in this context are interesting to you and your
            group?
            (At least three)<br>
            - What are some initial ideas for interactive systems that respond to these challenges or
            opportunities? (You will present at least 3) Ensure that you provide us with enough detail for your
            ideas that we can clearly evaluate. We need you to clearly explain:<br>
            - How you intend the app idea to work.<br>
            - Who in your domain it is for.<br>
            - What goals it addresses.<br>
            - Why you believe it to be viable.<br>
            - Finally, what more do you need to know to refine these ideas and then make the choice which one to
            develop?<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            After this part, our team needed to build an interaction framework. We focused on developing a prototype of
            an interactive system for the rest of the project and answered questions such as:
            Who is the specific audience (intended user) within your domain/context and what are the goals that your
            proposed idea/interface is driven by? (Show us some personas)
            How does the user interact with the system? (How does a user enter inputs to the device and get outputs from
            it? What type of input/output modalities are used?)
            Include some initial pen-and-paper sketches and storyboards for the user interface. Please do not show
            wireframes generated with Sketch, Figma, UXPin, Framer, or similar tools.
            <br>
            After this part, our team needed to design interactions within our framework. We included details of the
            style guide and pattern guide elements such as typeface, color palette, grid layouts, interactions, etc.
        </p>
        <h4>
            GOALS OF PILLPAL:
        </h4>
        <p>
            The goals of PillPal are to ensure that an elderly patient, such as Daryl, is able to take their medication
            as prescribed and improve their medication adherence. As missed doses can be particularly dangerous for an
            elderly patient, PillPal can help reduce its risk by providing timely reminders.

            PillPal can empower elderly patients to take control of and manage their medication unmonitored, allowing
            them to feel more independent and in control of their health and wellbeing.
        </p>
        <h4>
            STYLE GUIDE:
        </h4>
        <p>
            HEADINGS
            <br>
            We opted for Visby Round CF, a softer geometric sans-serif typeface, which can create a more approachable
            and friendly tone for elderly patients. This can help to put them at ease and make them feel more
            comfortable using PillPal.
            <br>
            BODY COPY<br>
            We opted for Helvetica, a sans-serif typeface that is highly legible, even at small sizes. Our elderly may
            have age-related visual impairments, such as reduced acuities or contrast sensitivity, and Helvetica's
            clarity can help to mitigate these issues. Additionally, Helvetica has a clean design with minimal
            ornamental features, which can help to reduce cognitive load for elderly patients and make it easier to
            focus on the content presented in PillPal.
            COLOR<br>
            We opted for Monochromatic Blues because it is a low-energy color that is easy on the eyes, making it a good
            choice for elderly patients who may have age-related visual impairments. The use of Monochromatic Blues can
            reduce their eye strains and fatigue. Blue is often associated with calmness and relaxation, making it a
            good choice for elderly patients who may experience anxiety related to managing their medications. As the
            color is also associated with trust and safety, using Monochromatic Blues in PillPal can convey a sense of
            trustworthiness.
        </p>

        <h4>
            PROBLEMS I ENCOUNTERED:
        </h4>
        <p>
            The problems we encountered during the entirety of the process was figuring out how to design with senior
            users in mind. There are not a lot of applications that consider seniors for their design which makes it
            harder for our team to research inspiration. When designing for seniors, it is important to make things
            larger and more visible to the eye. Every detail has to be taken into consideration as well as giving enough
            instructions for them. Another problem we encountered was learning how to use the prototyping software:
            Protopie. This was a new software each of us had to learn and it took some time to get used to all the
            different tools available to use. Fortunately, we were able to figure it out and successfully made a working
            prototype of our application, PillPal.
